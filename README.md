# Musician Gear Tracker

A comprehensive web application for musicians to track, maintain, and manage their musical equipment inventory.

## 🎸 Overview

Musician Gear Tracker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help musicians keep track of their instruments and equipment with specialized features for maintenance scheduling, condition monitoring, and valuation tracking. This application addresses a significant gap in the market for specialized tools that combine inventory management with maintenance tracking specifically tailored for musical equipment.
